## Conclusion
We can see that:
Caucasian race has the highest number of diagnosis in the dataset.
Since caucasian consists majority of the dataset we further focus on analysizing the caucasian race only.

1) Maximum number of inpatient for caucasian race is in the age group 20-30
2) Maximum number of outpatients for caucasian race is in the age group 80-90
3) Maximum number of emergency patients for caucasian race is in the age group 60-70
